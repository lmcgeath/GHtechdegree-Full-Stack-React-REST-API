//- UserSignUp - This component provides the "Sign Up" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to sign up by creating a new account. The component also renders a "Sign Up" button that when clicked sends a POST request to the REST API's /api/users route and signs in the user. This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).
