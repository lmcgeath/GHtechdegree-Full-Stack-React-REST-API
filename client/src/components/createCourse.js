//- CreateCourse - This component provides the "Create Course" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to create a new course. The component also renders a "Create Course" button that when clicked sends a POST request to the REST API's /api/courses route. This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).
